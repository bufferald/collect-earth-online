        The DigitalGlobe imagery layers have been reinstated using
        DG/Maxar's new EarthWatch API. However, there appear to be
        some issues with their tile ordering that we are currently
        looking into. Until this is resolved, all FAO institutions'
        projects will use BingAerial as a substitute for
        DigitalGlobeRecentImagery by default.

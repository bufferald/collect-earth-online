SecureWatch imagery can be added to an institution on the Review
Institution page. Just enter a Title, ConnectID, Start Date, End Date,
and Feature Profile. The imagery will then appear on the Collection
page's imagery dropdown.

NOTE: This imagery will only display results when zoomed in to a plot
level and will usually show a blank white map on the Collection page
overview map.

Maxar's SecureWatch imagery is being served up by a GeoServer, so
GetCapabilities, GetMap, and GetFeatureInfo requests should work as
usual.

GetCapabilities returns a list of available layers and feature
profiles for the provided ConnectId.

GetFeatureInfo can be used to retrieve features for all layers within
the bounding box. For example, this can be used to retrieve all of the
acquisitionDates for imagery within the current map view.

For GetMap requests, FEATURE_PROFILE and CQL_COVERAGE_FILTER are both
optional. The following fields can be used in the CQL_COVERAGE_FILTER
query:
